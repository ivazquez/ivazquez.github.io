**Current:** Master's Student - Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health

Giles is a first-year Master of Science student in Computational Biology and Quantitative Genetics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He completed his undergraduate studies in Molecular Biology and Genetics at McMaster University, where his thesis—supervised by Dr. Margaret Fahnestock—focused on the RNA-binding protein RBFOX1 and its regulatory effects in autism. During his junior year, he received a summer research scholarship from the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC) in Montréal. In his free time, Giles enjoys engaging in social advocacy initiatives and organizing community and club events. He is always excited to meet new people and learn from their diverse and fascinating experiences.
