**Current:** Master's Student - Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health

I am a first-year Master of Science student in Computational Biology and Quantitative Genetics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I completed my undergraduate studies in Molecular Biology and Genetics at McMaster University, where my thesis—supervised by Dr. Margaret Fahnestock—focused on the RNA-binding protein RBFOX1 and its regulatory effects in autism. During my junior year, I received a summer research scholarship from the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC) in Montréal. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in social advocacy initiatives and organizing community and club events. I am always excited to meet new people and learn from their diverse and fascinating experiences.
