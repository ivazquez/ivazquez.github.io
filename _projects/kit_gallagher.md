**Current:** PhD student - University of Oxford

Kit trained in mathematical sciences, studying Physics during his undergraduate and masters degrees at the University of Cambridge, before completing his PhD in Mathematics under the supervision of Philip Maini at the University of Oxford. Kit’s previous work applied mathematical modeling and deep reinforcement learning to treatment scheduling and patient outcome prediction in metastatic prostate cancer. This work was undertaken in close collaboration with Alexander Anderson at the Moffitt Cancer Center (Florida), sparking Kit’s passion for translational and clinically-applicable research. He also maintains a keen interest in epidemiology, and has co-developed a number of widely used software tools in this area.
