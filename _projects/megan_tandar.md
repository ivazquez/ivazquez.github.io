**Current:** Undergraduate student - Duke University

Megan Tandar is a second-year undergraduate at Duke University, currently studying Chemistry with a concentration in biochemistry and a minor in Asian American Diaspora Studies. She grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah, and began conducting research in autophagy in Dr. John David Symon’s lab during high school. She found a passion for translational research, joining Dr. Christine Elissa Eyler’s lab in the fall of her freshman year, studying the effects of radiation treatment on colorectal cancer. Apart from research, she is also the incoming president of the STEM Pathways for Inclusion, Readiness, and Excellence (SPIRE) Fellows Program at Duke, Events Co-Chair for Duke’s Asian Students Association, companion aide at the Forest at Duke, research assistant for Krystal Chung, and keyboardist and cofounder for the student-run band “The Trench.” Ultimately, she hopes to pursue graduate school in the biomedical sciences.
