**Previous:** Visiting PhD Student - Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Sohrab Shah Lab); PhD Student - IDIBELL, Barcelona (Francesc Viñals Lab)

**Current:** Postdoctoral Research Fellow - IRB Barcelona (Roger Gomis Lab)

Núria earned her PhD in Francesc Viñals' lab at IDIBELL, in Barcelona, where she investigated the metastatic process of high-grade serous ovarian cancer via tumorspheres. As a Fulbright Scholar, she conducted a one-year research stay in Sohrab Shah’s lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she strengthened her computational skills through various projects, including her master’s thesis in bioinformatics under the supervision of Ignacio. Upon returning to Spain, Núria joined Roger Gomis' lab at IRB Barcelona as a Postdoctoral Fellow, where she currently studies metastatic cell plasticity in breast cancer. With a hybrid profile, Núria integrates wet and dry lab approaches to study tumor metastasis. Her long-term goal is to establish an interdisciplinary research group that bridges cancer cell biology with advanced computational omics.
